#Card Hell Demo
Card hell is a card game made by Abscission where the player has to test both their strategic skill, and their reflexes: At first it appears to be a fairly standard TCG, but when the players monsters engage in battle with their enemies, an all out bullet hell minigame is initiated. The stats of the cards in this minigame are detemined by the stats of the card played.

The game is in a very early state as it has so far been programmed in 48 hours as part of the Global Game Jam 2016.


##Building

Running `build.bat` on Windows with VS2015 installed should result in a build being generated in build/x64 and build/x86.
